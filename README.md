# Transfalte

A comprehensive platform integrating OCR and translation services, supporting multi-language text recognition and translation.

## Directory Structure

- **backend**: Backend services, including implementations of OCR and translation functionalities.
    - `api`: Defines and generates gRPC service interfaces.
    - `cmd`: Entry points for the services.
    - `engine`: Includes OCR-related data and the Tesseract OCR engine.
    - `internal`: Core business logic and service implementations.
    - `pkg`: Shared utilities and middleware.
    - `bin`: Scripts for Docker builds and proto file generation.

- **frontend**: Frontend service, featuring a React-based interface and Nginx configuration.

- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose configuration file for service orchestration and deployment.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose

   cd backend
   make build
   ```

#### Frontend Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
